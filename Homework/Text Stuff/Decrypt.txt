There was an Old Man with a beard
Who said, 'It is just as I feared!
Two Owls and a Hen,
Four Larks and a Wren,
Have all built their nests in my beard!
Hello. It is I, the ruler of the world
Well... I am the future ruler of the world
I have not yet successfully conquered, but the day is coming
"You shall not know the day or the hour" -says the LORD.
oh... by the way... I will be your lord.
"And he sent his only son so that whoever believes in him will not perish, but have eternal life" John 3:16
